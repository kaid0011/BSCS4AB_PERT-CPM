        <p class="desc">In summary, <b>PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Technique)</b> and <b>CPM (Critical Path Method)</b> are 
          project management techniques used to plan, schedule, and control projects. PERT uses a probabilistic approach to determine 
          the probability of completing the project within a specific timeframe, while CPM is a deterministic approach that focuses 
          on identifying the critical path of a project. Both methods involve breaking down a project into smaller tasks, assigning 
          estimated durations, and determining task dependencies. Software tools are available to assist project managers in calculating 
          and visualizing PERT and CPM charts.

        <p class="secondpara">A PERT-created estimation has only 50 percent reliability. By using these different probability distributions in a scheduler calculator, project managers can perform simulations to model the potential impact of different scenarios and uncertainties 
        on the project timeline. This allows project managers to make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources and manage risks to ensure the project is completed on time and within budget.

        Normal, triangular, and BETA-PERT simulations are types of probability distributions that can be used in a scheduler calculator to perform simulations and generate project schedules.

        Normal distribution: In a normal distribution, the probability of an 
        event occurring is evenly distributed around the mean, and the probability 
        decreases as the distance from the mean increases. The normal distribution 
        is often used in scheduler calculators to represent task durations that are 
        evenly distributed around an average value.
      <br><br>
      Triangular distribution: In a triangular distribution, the probability of an 
      event occurring is highest at the most likely value, and decreases as the 
      values move away from the most likely value. Triangular distributions are 
      often used in scheduler calculators to represent task durations that have a 
      range of possible values, but are most likely to fall within a specific range.
      <br><br>
      BETA-PERT distribution: The BETA-PERT distribution is a type of probability 
      distribution that is used in PERT analysis. It combines aspects of both the 
      normal and triangular distributions to model uncertainty in task durations. 
      The BETA-PERT distribution is characterized by three parameters: the minimum, 
      most likely, and maximum duration for a task. It is often used in scheduler 
      calculators to perform simulations that take into account the uncertainty and 
      variability of task durations.
