                <p>Normal Distribution or Standard Normal Distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. This is considered to be the most important probability distribution in statistics due to the fact that a lot of continuous data in the aspects of nature and psychology display a bell-shaped curve in compilation and graphing. It accurately models natural events. In practice, the normal distribution is also used to model non-negative distributions.</p>
