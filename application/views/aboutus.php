    <h1>About the Developers</h1>
    <p>Welcome to WAPS with Simulation! We are a team of dedicated and passionate individuals currently pursuing our Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the esteemed Technological University of the Philippines. As fourth-year students, we have united our talents and expertise to embark on an exciting journey in creating WAPS with Simulation as a pivotal component of our thesis project.</p>
    <p>Driven by our shared enthusiasm for computer science and a commitment to innovation, we have recognized the immense potential of simulation-based learning in revolutionizing the educational landscape. With a deep understanding of the power of technology and its ability to enhance learning experiences, we have set out to develop WAPS with Simulation, an exceptional platform that combines educational content with immersive calculators and simulations to provide a unique and engaging approach to project management.</p>
    <p>Our collective academic journey at the Technological University of the Philippines has equipped us with a strong foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, software development methodologies, and more. Drawing from this knowledge and our diverse skill sets, we have collaborated extensively to bring WAPS with Simulation to life.</p>
    <p>Throughout the development process, we have meticulously planned, designed, and implemented various components to ensure the platform's effectiveness and usability. From conceptualizing the architecture to crafting intuitive user interfaces, from constructing robust back-end algorithms to conducting comprehensive testing, we have dedicated countless hours to perfecting every aspect of WAPS with Simulation.</p>
    <p>Allow us to introduce ourselves:</p>
