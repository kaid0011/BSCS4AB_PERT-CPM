                <h1>How WAPS with Simulation's Normal Distribution Works?</h1><br>
                <p><strong>Step 1: </strong> Identifies all the activities involved in the project and arranges them in a logical sequence using their Activity IDs.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2: </strong> Determines the 3 durations: optimistic (a), most likely (m), and pessimistic (b), which are the estimated times
                    provided by the user for each activity that are required to complete the activities.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3: </strong> Calculates the mean (ùúá) of the 3 durations for each activity.</p>
                <img src="<?= base_url('assets/images/howitworks/normal_mean.png') ?>">
                <p><strong>Step 4: </strong> Calculates the variance (ùúé<sup>2</sup>) of the 3 durations for each activity.</p>
                <img src="<?= base_url('assets/images/howitworks/normal_variance.png') ?>">
                <p><strong>Step 5: </strong> Calculates the standard deviation (ùúé) using the variance for each activity.</p>
                <img src="<?= base_url('assets/images/howitworks/normal_sd.png') ?>">
                <p><strong>Step 6: </strong> Computes the duration (T) by using the norm.ppf function from scipy.stats to get the normal distribution value
                    (or the inverse of the cumulative distribution function) for which a given probability is the required value.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 7: </strong> Identifies the pre-requisites of each activity, which must be completed before another activity starts.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 8: </strong> Performs a Forward Pass.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Forward Pass starts with the first activity, to determine the Early Start Time (ES) and Early Finish Time (EF) for each activity.

                    <li>
                        <p>For each activity, WAPS calculates the ES by adding the duration of the preceding activity to its ES. If an activity has more than one predecessor, the predecessor to be added is the highest one. For the first activity, the ES is equal to 0.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Then, calculates the EF by adding the duration of the activity to its ES.</p>

                        <p>Identifies the slack of each activity to know the critical path, which is the sequence of activities that has the longest duration and has slack equals to 0.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 9: </strong> Performs a Backward Pass.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>For each activity, WAPS calculates the LF by subtracting the duration of the following activity from its LS.

                    <li>
                        <p>Then, calculates the LS by subtracting the duration of the activity from its LF. This process continues until the LS and LF have been calculated for all activities in the network.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Calculates the slack (S) for each activity by subtracting the activity's EF from its LF or ES from its LS. If S isequal to zero, the activity is a critical value and completes the critical path.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Uses the ES, EF, LS, LF, and S values to identify the project's Critical Path and determine the shortest possible time required to complete the project.</p>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>Step 10: </strong> Uses the Earliest Start Time (ES) and Latest Finish Time (LF) of each activity to create a Gantt Chart. The darker colored bars represent the critical values which complete the Critical Path.</p>
